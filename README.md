**airship_adventure**
This C# code was taken from one of my unity games. It was written for the Udon Sharp compiler, which specializes in the creation Multiplayer VR games. A lot of standard C# features are still missing from Udon.

**pointcloud_processing**
This C++ code was written using Open3D and the ROS framework. It demonstrates the usage of complex 3D Math operations for the sake of automated wire fence scanning and damage analysis.

**geometry_visualizer**
I wrote this Python code recently for a Geospatial Data visualization exercise. The fields_visualizer.py code is easy to execute. It simply shows coordinates for how to position agricultural fields after being given a polygon.
